# Acceptance Testing Strategy - ENS-Wordle

## Testing Philosophy

### User-Centric Approach
- **Real User Scenarios**: Test actual gameplay flows, not just technical functions
- **Device Reality**: Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- **Network Conditions**: Test on 3G, WiFi, and offline scenarios
- **Accessibility First**: Include screen readers and keyboard navigation in standard testing

### Risk-Based Prioritization
- **High Risk**: ENS integration, game state persistence, mobile responsiveness
- **Medium Risk**: Animations, edge case error handling, performance
- **Low Risk**: Visual polish, non-critical features

## Epic-Level Acceptance Testing

### Epic 1: Foundation & Core Game Infrastructure

#### Pre-Development Checklist
- [ ] **Environment Setup**: Development environment configured per setup guide
- [ ] **Test Data**: Curated ENS list available with at least 10 names
- [ ] **Device Access**: iOS device, Android device, desktop browser available

#### Epic Completion Criteria
```
GIVEN the core game infrastructure is complete
WHEN I test the complete user journey
THEN I can successfully:
✓ Start a new game
✓ Enter guesses using virtual keyboard
✓ See correct feedback colors (green/yellow/gray)
✓ Complete a game (win or lose)
✓ Persist game state across browser refresh
✓ Play on mobile and desktop
```

#### Critical Test Scenarios
1. **Complete Game Flow (Happy Path)**
   - Start new game → Enter 6 guesses → See win/loss state → Start another game
   - **Success Criteria**: Smooth flow without errors or confusion

2. **Game State Persistence**
   - Start game → Make 2 guesses → Close browser → Reopen
   - **Success Criteria**: Game resumes exactly where left off

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Test on iPhone SE (375px) and large Android (414px+)
   - **Success Criteria**: All elements visible and interactive

### Epic 2: ENS Integration & Avatar Display

#### Pre-Development Checklist
- [ ] **ENS Test Cases**: List of names with known avatar status (has/doesn't have)
- [ ] **Network Testing**: Ability to simulate slow/failed connections
- [ ] **RPC Endpoints**: Primary and backup endpoints configured

#### Epic Completion Criteria
```
GIVEN ENS integration is complete
WHEN I test various ENS scenarios
THEN the system handles:
✓ Names with avatars (display correctly)
✓ Names without avatars (show placeholder)
✓ Network failures (graceful fallback)
✓ Slow loading (timeout to placeholder)
✓ Invalid names (error handling)
```

#### Critical Test Scenarios
1. **Avatar Loading Variations**
   - Test 5 names: 2 with avatars, 2 without, 1 with broken image
   - **Success Criteria**: Appropriate display for each scenario

2. **Network Resilience**
   - Start game offline → Enable network → Disable network mid-game
   - **Success Criteria**: Game remains playable throughout

3. **Performance Under Load**
   - Rapidly start 10 new games in succession
   - **Success Criteria**: No memory leaks, consistent performance

### Epic 3: Mobile-First UI & Game Polish

#### Pre-Development Checklist
- [ ] **Device Matrix**: Test matrix of iOS/Android versions defined
- [ ] **Accessibility Tools**: Screen reader software available for testing
- [ ] **Performance Tools**: Lighthouse and mobile testing tools configured

#### Epic Completion Criteria
```
GIVEN the polished UI is complete
WHEN I test the complete experience
THEN the app provides:
✓ Smooth 60fps animations on mid-range devices
✓ Accessible experience for screen reader users
✓ PWA installation and offline capability
✓ Sub-2-second load times on 3G
✓ Intuitive touch interactions
```

## Story-Level Acceptance Testing

#### Story Testing Process
1. **Developer Self-Test**: Developer validates ACs before submitting for review
2. **Technical Review**: Code review focusing on testability and edge cases
3. **Product Owner Review**: PO validates business requirements and user experience
4. **Cross-Device Testing**: Test on minimum device matrix

#### Story Completion Checklist
```
